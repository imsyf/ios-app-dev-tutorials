# Scrumdinger
 An iOS app that helps teams manage their daily scrums. To help scrums short and focused, Scrumdinger uses visual and audio cues to indicate when and how long each attendee should speak. This app also displays a progress screen that shows the time remaining in the meeting and creates a transcript that the user can refer to later.
